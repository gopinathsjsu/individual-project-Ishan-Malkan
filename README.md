CMPE 202 INDIVIDUAL PROJECT - BILLING

SPRING 2022.

SUBMITTED BY, ISHAN HITESH MALKAN, SJSU ID: *****1968

THIS README FILE CONTAINS DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS REGARDING HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM

THE PROJECT IS A “JAVA WITH MAVEN” JAVA APPLICATION WHICH CAN BE RUN IN ANY IDE SUCH AS NETBEANS.
THE PROJECT CONTAINS FOUR JAVA FILES NAMELY, Billing.java, GetItems.java, GetCards.java and GetOrder.java
THE MAIN CLASS IS Billing.java AS REQUIRED BY THE QUESTION.
THE REMAINING THREE CLASSES ARE SINGLETON CLASSES TO LOAD DATA FROM CSV TO INTERNAL DATABASE.
IN EACH OF THE THREE SINGLETON CLASSES, ON LINE 22, THE PATH IS CODED TO THE RESPECTIVE CSV FILES (Items.csv, Cards.csv, Order.csv). THIS PATH IS NEEDED TO BE CHANGED WHEN RUNNING IN SOME OTHER MACHINE.
ONCE THESE THREE PATHS ARE CHANGED, THE PROJECT IS GOOD TO RUN, IT WILL WRITE AN OUTPUT FILE (bill.csv OR invalid_order.txt) IN THE SAME FOLDER WHERE THE JAVA PROJECT IS PRESENT AS PER THE CREDIBILITY OF THE INPUT ORDER.
THE CODE ITSELF IS CLEANLY WRITTEN AND WELL COMMENTED TO EXPLAIN EACH AND EVERY STEP.
